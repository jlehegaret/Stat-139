To Dos

__Steve__ - adding the output feature so that we can submit to Kaggle as we go, continuing to test assumptions, revising his "distance from competitor" approach

__Desiree__ - investigating the random effects model with a focus on time, and investigating a paired data technique, and sharing helpful data exploration visuals :-)

__Libby__ - investigating the random effects model with a focus on stores, and looking into linearity

__Jennifer__ - adding/fixing the derived data of weekday (by name), season, and maybe a "just reopened" one (depending on test data).  Also the GitHub stuff.
